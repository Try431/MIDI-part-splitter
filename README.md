## Goals

- [x] Create emphasized MIDI files
- [x] Set emphasized track to a different MIDI instrument
- [x] Create .mp3 files from MIDI files
- [x] Start building a GUI for the tool (decided not to pursue this)
- [x] Build out the single MIDI to component MIDI parts split in AWS (ideally Lambda)
- [x] Component MIDI files are uploaded to S3
- [x] Create S3 event trigger for intermediate MIDI part files for kicking off MIDI to MP3 conversion lambda
- [x] Build out MIDI to MP3 conversion in an AWS Lambda
- [x] Final MP3 files are uploaded to S3
- [x] Create S3 upload event trigger for kicking off the flow (via SQS)
- [x] Build basic frontend that allows for file upload to S3
- [ ] Build basic frontend functionality for downloading final MP3 files from S3
- [ ] Add ability for users to be able to customize payload to the MIDI split lambda (probably via API Gateway)


## How to use

### View flag options

````
$ ./MIDI-part-splitter -h
Usage of ./MIDI-part-splitter:
  -d string
    	Directory containing .mid files you wish to parse - will recursively search subdirectories
    	(e.g., './MIDI-part-splitter -d ./dir/to/search/')
  -f string
    	Name of .mid file you wish to parse
    	(e.g., './MIDI-part-splitter -f midi_file.mid')
  -inst int
    	Instrument number for emphasized track - see README for instrument list
    	(e.g., './MIDI-part-splitter -f midi_file.mid -inst 22)  (default 65)
  -l string
    	List of comma-separated MIDI files to be parsed
  -o string
    	Directory where mp3 files will be stored
    	(e.g., './MIDI-part-splitter -f midi_file.mid -o ./dir/to/store/mp3s) (default "./output/mp3s")
  -quiet
    	Whether or not to silence standard output when running (will still allow stderr) (default true)
  -vol int
    	Volume of de-emphasized voice tracks - must be between 0 and 100
    	(e.g., './MIDI-part-splitter -f midi_file.mid -vol 30) (default 40)
````

### Examples 
Given an `assets` directory containing the following MIDI files:


````
$ ls assets/
dominefiliunigenite.mid cumsanctospiritu.mid
````

#### Example 1 - Parsing a single MIDI file

````
$ ./MIDI-part-splitter -f ./assets/dominefiliunigenite.mid
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Alto.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Tenor.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Bass.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Piano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Converting './output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid' to an MP3 file in 'output/mp3s'
Converting './output/dominefiliunigenite_Alto.mid' to an MP3 file in 'output/mp3s'
...
All done! ðŸ˜„ Enjoy your MP3 files!
````

#### Example 2 - Parsing a single MIDI file, and setting the volume of the non-emphasized tracks

````
$ ./MIDI-part-splitter -f ./assets/cumsanctospiritu.mid -vol 20
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 20
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Alto.mid with all other tracks set to volume 20
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Tenor.mid with all other tracks set to volume 20
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Bass.mid with all other tracks set to volume 20
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Piano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 20
Converting './output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid' to an MP3 file in 'output/mp3s'
Converting './output/dominefiliunigenite_Alto.mid' to an MP3 file in 'output/mp3s'
...
All done! ðŸ˜„ Enjoy your MP3 files!
````

#### Example 3 - Parsing all MIDI files in a directory

````
$ ./MIDI-part-splitter -d ./assets/
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Alto.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Tenor.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Bass.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Piano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/cumsanctospiritu_Soprano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/cumsanctospiritu_Alto.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/cumsanctospiritu_Tenor.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/cumsanctospiritu_Bass.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/cumsanctospiritu_Piano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Converting './output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid' to an MP3 file in 'output/mp3s'
...
Converting './output/cumsanctospiritu_Soprano.mid' to an MP3 file in 'output/mp3s'
...
All done! ðŸ˜„ Enjoy your MP3 files!
````

#### Example 4 - Sending the output mp3s to a specific folder, and quieting stdout
````
$ ./MIDI-part-splitter -f assets/dominefiliunigenite.mid -o ../created_mp3s -quiet
Starting split & conversion process...
All done! ðŸ˜„ Enjoy your MP3 files!
````

#### Example 5 - Passing in a list of comma-separated MIDI files to parse
````
$ ./MIDI-part-splitter -l assets/dominefiliunigenite.mid,assets/dominefiliunigenite.mid
Starting split & conversion process...
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Creating ./output/dominefiliunigenite_Alto.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
...
Creating ./output/cumsanctospiritu_Piano.mid with all other tracks set to volume 40
Converting './output/dominefiliunigenite_Soprano.mid' to an MP3 file in 'output/mp3s'
...
All done! ðŸ˜„ Enjoy your MP3 files!
